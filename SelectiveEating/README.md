# Selective Eating

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A simple quality-of-life mod to make eating easier and automatic with
configurable settings.

## Features

- Automatically eat food when you lose some health or energy. You can
  configure this eating priority strategy in the menu to either
  prioritize replenishing the most health or energy as much as possible,
  the lowest priced food to save money, or turn this extra strategy off
  at any time.

- Entirely skip eating animation (and the world pauses that come with
  it) for you to eat food on the go, automatically. Configurable.

- Forbid certain food from being eaten. Configurable.

- Prioritize the food in your inventoryâ€™s active row for eating.

- An option to stay in the same facing direction even after eating.

- Increase or decrease eating time intervals for role-playing/challenge
  or performance reasons.

- Options can be configured through the [Generic Config
  Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098) or
  `config.json` file within the `SelectiveEating` mod directory.
