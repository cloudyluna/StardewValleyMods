# Selective Eating

A simple quality of life mod to make eating easier and automatically
with configurable settings.

## Features

- Automatically eats food when you lost some health or energy. You can
  configure this eating priority strategy in the configure menu to
  either prioritizing on replenishing the most health or energy as much
  as possible, the lowest priced food to save money or simply turn this
  extra strategy off at any time.

- Entirely skip eating animation (and the world pauses that comes with
  it) for you to eat food on the go, automatically. Configurable.

- Forbid certain food from being eaten. Configurable.

- Prioritize the food in your inventoryâ€™s active row for eating.

- An option to stay in the same facing direction even after eating.

- Increase or decrease eating time interval for role playing/challenge
