# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. The
format is based on [Keep A
Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## \[1.0.1\] - 2024-09-16

### Fixed

- Crab pots unable to collect jelly when player picks **mariner** skill
  (fishing level 10).

## \[1.0.0\] - 2024-09-05

Major overhaul.

### Added

- Crab pots in [mines/underground
  caves/dungeons](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/The_Mines) (level 20,
  60, 100) now can collect jellies and the only jelly they will catch is
  cave jelly. Farm cave and Witch’s swamp `are not affected`.

- Jellies can be of different quality than normal.

### Changed

- `Breaking change:` Treat jellies catch or collect chance like any
  regular crab pot fish object (clam, mussel, crab, etc) instead of
  trash. As it seems some players are farming jellies items and uses
  extra skill perks mod to completely remove trash or increase other
  crab pot fish, catch rate later in the game, I find it probably makes
  more sense to convert jelly from a "trash" item into a crab pot fish
  one in the long term.

- Rebalanced global river and ocean jellies catch rate so they don’t
  always completely overtake things like crabs or clams all the time as
  these items are rarer than trash items. This is made to accommodate
  the change made above.

### Removed

- The option to replace all the trash from configuration menu. Users
  should move to use other mods that will remove trash spawn chance
  instead as it is now considered a non-goal and won’t be much of use
  for this project.

## \[0.3.0\] - 2024-09-04

### Added

- Crab pots in cave farm and witch’s swamp area now have much higher
  chance to collect cave jellies.

- 10% more chance for crab pots in cave farm than witch’s swamp to
  collect cave jellies.

## \[0.2.0\] - 2024-08-29

### Added

- Option to replace all trash that will be collected by crab pots with
  jellies. Configurable with Generic Mod Config Menu.

- Option to enable or disable this mod with config menu.

## \[0.1.0\]

- Initial release.
