	\section{StardewValleyMods by Cloudyluna}
	
	My personal collection of Stardew Valley mods that I wrote (and ongoing) for fun. Nothing serious here.
	
	
	\subsection{Building}
	
	If you have \texttt{nix} installed, run \texttt{nix develop} to load the development environment.
	In a nutshell, \texttt{cd} into any \textit{subproject} and run \texttt{make} to build the project.
	
	\begin{quote}
		Attention: Make sure you already have set up \$\textit{GAME\_PATH} pointing to your Stardew Valley game folder first.
	\end{quote}
	
	\begin{verbatim}
		# Example to build SelectiveEating
		cd SelectiveEating
		make
	\end{verbatim}
	
	\subsection{License}
	
	This project is licensed under the AGPL-3.0-or-later License - see the \texttt{LICENSE} file for details.
