	\section{StardewValleyMods by Cloudyluna}
	
	My personal collection of Stardew Valley mods that I wrote (and ongoing) for fun. Nothing serious here.
	
	
	\subsection{Building}
	
	If you have \texttt{nix} installed, run \texttt{nix develop} to load the development environment.
	In a nutshell, \texttt{cd} into any \textit{subproject} and run \texttt{make} to build the project.

		Attention: Make sure you have setup \$\textit{GAME\_PATH} pointing to your Stardew Valley game folder first.
